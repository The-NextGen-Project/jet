> **Note:** For building the project on windows, it can be done by simply building with MSVC or, if you have MinGW installed it will work with that C compiler as well. For setting up a build system that is fast, I reccommend using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) which works on Windows, Linux, and Mac as a CMake generator.
