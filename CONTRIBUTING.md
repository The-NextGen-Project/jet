Code of Conduct.
----------------
Before starting the rest of the process, please take time read and understand the contributing
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community-Projects).

Style Guidelines
----------------
All programs under the NextGen Project follow the following C++ Style Guidlines.

* Getter and Setter functions are to be named using `camelCase`
* Static Functions (including in namespaces and in classes) should be denoted with `MyFunction` notation
* Class and Struct member **functions** should be denoted with`snake_case`
* Class and Struct member **variables** should be deonoted with `snake_case`
* When accessing private member variables, they should be accessed with `this` notation
* Don't be *too* generous with your comments. Use them appropriately, especially when describing a complicated task.
* Preprocessors have a `\t` between the '#'. For example: `#  include <iostream>`. This is done to be consistant with config.

> **Note:** There are a few exceptions to the rules above: If we create an STL-like object, keep styling
> based on STL styling, and just make sure to use common sense. If something has a very long typename and 
> has better readibility using trailing return type, use it, **prioritize readibility** over anything else.


Spread the Word
---------------

Another way to contribute is to write about Jet and the NextGen Project, or speak about Jet on
some online forums to encourage a friendly discussion. The language is at its early stages, so 
we want as much exposure as possible.
